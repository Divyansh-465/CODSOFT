# C++ Projects README

This repository contains four C++ projects that I've developed. Each project is designed to demonstrate various aspects of C++ programming and can serve as a learning resource for those interested in the language. 

## 1. Number Guessing Game

### Description
The Number Guessing Game is a classic text-based game where the computer selects a random number, and the player has to guess it within a certain number of tries. It's a fun project to understand basic input/output handling and conditional statements in C++.

### How to Play
1. Run the program.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to guess the number within the allowed attempts.

## 2. Simple Calculator

### Description
The Simple Calculator is a console application that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). It showcases the use of functions and switch-case statements for menu-driven user interaction.

### How to Use
1. Run the program.
2. Choose the desired operation from the menu.
3. Enter the numbers you want to perform the operation on.

## 3. Tic Tac Toe

### Description
Tic Tac Toe is a two-player, text-based game where players take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid to win by getting three of their marks in a row. This project explores the concepts of arrays, loops, and conditional statements in C++.

### How to Play
1. Run the program.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to make your moves.
3. Try to get three of your marks in a row to win.

## 4. To-Do List

### Description
The To-Do List application is a simple task management tool. It allows you to add, view, and delete tasks, and it demonstrates file handling in C++. It saves tasks to a text file, allowing you to persist your to-do list between sessions.

### How to Use
1. Run the program.
2. Follow the menu to add, view, or delete tasks.
3. Your tasks will be saved to a text file for future reference.

## Getting Started

These projects are designed to be beginner-friendly. To get started, ensure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system. You can compile and run the programs from the command line or an integrated development environment (IDE).

### Prerequisites

You need a C++ compiler such as g++, Visual C++, or Xcode, depending on your platform. Make sure you have it installed and configured correctly.

### Running the Programs

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project folder you want to run.
3. Compile the source code using your C++ compiler.
4. Run the executable file generated.

Feel free to explore and modify the source code to learn more about C++ programming.
